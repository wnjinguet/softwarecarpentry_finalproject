# The goal of this code is to create and run a quiz game in python using some key concepts learned throughout the semester
# First I define the different functions that will be used in this game.
# Later I create a library and answer choices for the game.
# Afterwards, there is a portion that reveals the user's score. Based on that score, they either get a celebratory message or a message prompting them to continue to practice, based on their score. 
# After several trials, the user's scores are graphed to visually show progress.
