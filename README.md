The following program is a quiz game that can be used for studying in any given course, synonymous to programs such as Quizlet.

1. Requiresments for running the code

- The installation of the latest version of python
- The installation of the Matplotlib package in python which can be done in the user's terminal 

2. Explanation of the program

The following quiz studying program was created to help students in their studying, especially during finals. This game takes a series of multiple choice questions and correspoint answer choices and presents them to a user. The user is able to answer the questions by typing letters A-D as their responses. The system instantly grades the answer of the user by comparing it with the key embedded in the program. Once the user answers all the questions, their percentage score is generated. After each game, the user is asked what their score was. Once entered, if the score is greater than 75%, the user receives a congratulatory message. If the score is less thatn 75%, then the user will be prompted to continue practicing. The user will also be asked at the end if they would like to continue playing and giving an option of yes or no. If answered yes, the game continues. If answer no, but the score was less than 75%, then the game will keep going one more round and then it will stop. After three trials, the user is asked to enter their scores. Using Matplotib, a graph is then generated to show the progress across three trials. 

3. How to run the code
- Save the code in a text editor on your desktop
- Open the code in your terminal: "python quiz.py"
- Answer the questions as presented by entering a letter A-D
- Once done, respond to the prompts.

4. Output examples

Images have been added to demonstrate what the output should be. A plot has been added to the repository as a reference for the plot that will be generated.
